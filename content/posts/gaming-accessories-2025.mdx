## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between wired and wireless gaming accessories?
Modern wireless gaming accessories in 2025 have virtually eliminated latency concerns, with response times often matching or exceeding wired alternatives. Wireless offers freedom of movement and cleaner setups, while wired ensures you never worry about battery life.

### Are expensive gaming chairs worth it?
High-quality gaming chairs like the Secretlab Titan Evo are designed for extended use with superior ergonomics, premium materials, and long-term durability. While expensive upfront, they often last 5–10 years and can prevent back problems from poor posture. For casual gamers, mid-range options offer good value, but serious gamers benefit from premium chairs.

### How much should I invest in a gaming monitor?
Your monitor budget should match your gaming priorities. For competitive gaming, invest in high refresh rates (240Hz+) and low input lag, typically. For immersive single-player games, prioritize resolution and color accuracy. Casual gamers can find excellent options. Remember, your monitor is a long-term investment that affects every gaming session.
