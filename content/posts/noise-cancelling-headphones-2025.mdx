## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are noise-cancelling headphones safe for long use?
Yes, modern ANC headphones are safe for extended use. The technology works by generating sound waves that cancel ambient noise, which actually reduces the overall sound pressure on your ears. However, take regular breaks during very long sessions to prevent ear fatigue.

### Do they work without music?
Active noise cancellation works independently of audio playback. You can use ANC headphones purely for noise reduction in noisy environments like airplanes, offices, or cafes without playing any music.

### What's the difference between passive and active noise cancellation?
Passive noise cancellation relies on the physical design and materials to block sound (like ear cup padding), while active noise cancellation uses microphones and speakers to generate sound waves that cancel ambient noise. The best headphones combine both approaches for maximum effectiveness.
