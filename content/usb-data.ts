    question: "Why use USB-C?",
    answer:
      "USB-C is the universal standard for modern devices, offering faster data transfer, higher power delivery, and reversible connectivity. It simplifies your setup by using one cable type for charging, data transfer, and video output across laptops, phones, tablets, and accessories.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are all cables safe?",
    answer:
      "Not all USB-C cables are created equal. Quality cables from reputable brands include proper safety certifications and built-in protections. Always choose cables that match your device's power requirements and look for certifications like USB-IF compliance to ensure safe operation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does USB-C support fast charging?",
    answer:
      "Yes, USB-C supports fast charging through Power Delivery (PD) technology, delivering up to 100W of power. This allows rapid charging of laptops, tablets, and phones. The actual charging speed depends on both your device and charger supporting the same PD standards.",
