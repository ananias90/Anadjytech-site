      <p>
        As an Amazon Associate, we may earn commissions from qualifying purchases made
        through links on this site. This does not affect the price you pay.
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
      <p>
        Some links on AnadjyTech are “affiliate links.” If you click an affiliate link and
        purchase a product, we may receive a small commission. The product price is the same
        whether you use our link or go directly to the vendor’s website.
      </p>

      <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
      <p>
        Our recommendations are based on research, testing, and experience. Affiliate
        partnerships do not influence our product selections or opinions.
      </p>

      <h2>Pricing & Availability</h2>
      <p>
        Product prices and availability change frequently. Any price or availability
        information displayed on Amazon at the time of purchase will apply to your order.
        If we display prices, we include the time of the last update.
      </p>
