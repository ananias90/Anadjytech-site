    content: `## Quick Picks

• **Students** — Light, durable models with all-day battery
• **Creators on a budget** — sRGB 100% displays for color accuracy
• **Battery champ** — 10+ hours for mobile work
• **2-in-1** — Touchscreen flexibility for notes and presentations
• **Gaming-lite** — Integrated graphics for casual gaming

## How We Chose

We evaluated laptops based on display quality (brightness, color accuracy), real-world battery tests, thermal performance and fan noise, keyboard and trackpad quality, and serviceability (upgradeable components). Our testing focuses on everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and light creative work.

## The Picks (2025)

### Everyday Champion
**Generic Model A** — Balanced performance with 14" IPS display, 10-hour battery, and quiet operation. Perfect for students and office work.
*Pros:* Great keyboard, solid build quality, good port selection
*Cons:* Average webcam, limited gaming capability

### Creator's Choice
**Generic Model B** — 15.6" display with 100% sRGB coverage, 16GB RAM, and decent thermals for light photo/video editing.
*Pros:* Color-accurate screen, upgradeable storage, USB-C PD charging
*Cons:* Slightly heavier, fans audible under load

### Budget Winner
**Generic Model C** — 13" ultraportable with surprising battery life and solid build quality at the lowest price point.
*Pros:* Excellent value, lightweight, quiet operation
*Cons:* 8GB RAM limit, smaller screen, fewer ports

## Buying Advice Under $800

### Screen & Color
Look for IPS panels with 300+ nits brightness for outdoor visibility. sRGB 100% coverage matters for photo editing and content creation. Avoid TN panels which have poor viewing angles and color reproduction.

### Performance & Thermals
Integrated graphics handle everyday tasks well but struggle with demanding games. Modern CPUs rarely thermal throttle in this price range, but check reviews for fan noise under sustained loads.

### Battery & Chargers
USB-C Power Delivery charging is convenient and future-proof. Look for 65W+ adapters that can charge phones and tablets too. Real-world battery life varies significantly between models.

### Upgrades & Warranty
Most budget laptops allow SSD upgrades but RAM is often soldered. Check teardown guides before buying. Extended warranties can be worth it for students who travel frequently.

## FAQs

## Conclusion

The sub-$800 laptop market offers excellent value in 2025, with solid performance for everyday tasks and surprising battery life. Focus on display quality and build construction over raw specs — a laptop that lasts four years is better than one that's fast for two.
